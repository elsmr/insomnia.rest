**Insomnia now officially supports [gRPC](grpc.io/)!** 🎉 

<!--more-->

gRPC has been a highly requested feature, and we're excited to release this into the wild. This initial release includes support for all four streaming types, simple TLS, cancellations, and concurrency.

In the future, we will look to add support for metadata and custom certificates, improve proto file management, and link gRPC with Insomnia environments. We look forward to your feedback; please request features or report bugs using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/new/choose)! ♥️

A total of 17 unique contributors were a part of this release, making it one of our biggest to date! 🤗
